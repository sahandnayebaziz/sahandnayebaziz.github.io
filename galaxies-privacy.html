    <h1>Galaxies Terms and Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting Galaxies' terms of service. Please read this carefully before
      using our app, services, and products. This is a contract between you and Galaxies. If you have
      any questions or suggestions, please <a href="mailto:galaxiesdev@gmail.com">contact us</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <h3>Accepting the Terms</h3>
    <p>
      Please read these Terms and our <a href="./galaxies-community-guidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a> (collectively,
       the "<strong>Agreement</strong>") carefully before using the Galaxies iOS application (the "<strong>App</strong>")
       and/or other domains, websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or Content provided by Galaxies. By using
       or accessing the App, you (<strong>"User"</strong> or <strong>"you"</strong>) agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <h3>Modifications to the Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      Galaxies reserves the right to modify this Agreement by posting a revised Agreement on and/or through
      the App and providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via email where possible and otherwise
      through the App using a notification or other means. Modifications to the Agreement will not apply retroactively. You are responsible
      for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may sometimes ask you to review and explicitly agree to or reject a revised version of this Agreement. In such cases,
      modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version. If you choose to reject modifications to
      the Agreement, you are not permitted to use the App.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Sharing Data</h3>
    <p>
      Your data is not shared with anybody unless required by law.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Storing Data</h3>
    <p>
      Galaxies only stores the data it needs to function properly. You provide an email address,
      a username, and a password when signing up. These three values are saved and these only. Galaxies
      does not save your IP address or your location.<br /><br />

      This is important: When you add an image to your personal Galaxy, the image is
      stored securely with a random filename in a file store that is not publicly-accessable
      for exploration. When you change images in your personal Galaxy, the original images are not deleted
      as they could be images that another Galaxies user has saved in the "Saved Galaxies" section of Galaxies.<br /><br />

      Saving is an important part of Galaxies because it allows for one user to
      save another's Galaxy as-is on a certain date and keep that Galaxy
      viewable for as long as they would like. Only a Galaxy's current images (up to 4)
      are viewable at any given time by navigating to a user's Galaxy, so the saving
      feature lets users remember and capture photos shared by other users when they
      like something that was posted while still allowing for users to change their
      own Galaxy without leaving a long trail of images always showing.<br /><br />

      Also important: Images shared to Galaxies by one user can be saved to a device
      by another user by a save button or by screenshotting an image. These images are out
      of Galaxies' control.<br /><br />

      DO NOT UPLOAD PHOTOS TO GALAXIES YOU WOULD NOT WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO SEE!
    </p>

    <h3>Your email address</h3>
    <p>
      Your email address is saved to be used as a form of verification and to have a
      way to contact you and other users with important Galaxies-related messages,
      should a message ever be necessary.<br /><br />

      Your email will never be sold to, let alone shared with, a third party.
