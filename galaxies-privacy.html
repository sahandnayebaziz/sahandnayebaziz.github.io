  <h1>Galaxies Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Sharing Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is not shared with anybody unless required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Storing Data</h2>
  <p>
    Galaxies only stores the data it needs to function properly. You provide an email address,
    a username, and a password when signing up. These three values are saved and these only. Galaxies
    does not save your IP address or your location.<br /><br />

    This is important: When you add an image to your personal Galaxy, the image is
    securely stored without a random filename in a file store that is not publicly-accessable
    for exploration. When you change images in your personal Galaxy, the original images are not deleted
    as they could be images that somebody else has saved in the "Saved Galaxies" section of Galaxies.<br /><br />

    Saving is an important part of Galaxies because it allows for one user to
    save another's Galaxy as-is on a certain date and keep that Galaxy
    viewable for as long as they'd like. Only a Galaxy's current images (up to 4)
    are viewable at any given time by navigating to a user's Galaxy, so the saving
    feature let's users remember and capture photos shared by other users when they
    like something that was posted while still allowing for users to change their
    own Galaxy without leaving a long trail of images always showing.<br /><br />

    Also important: Images shared to Galaxies by one user can be saved to a device
    by another user by a save button or by screenshotting an image. These images are out
    of Galaxies' control.<br /><br />

    DO NOT UPLOAD PHOTOS TO GALAXIES YOU WOULD NOT WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO SEE!
  </p>

  <h3>Your email address</h3>
  <p>
    Your email address is saved to be used as a form of verification and to have a
    way to contact you and other users with important Galaxies-related messages,
    should a message ever be necessary.<br /><br />

    Your email will never be sold to, let alone shared with, a third party.
