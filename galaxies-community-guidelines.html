    <h1>Galaxies Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p>
      Galaxies was made to be a beautiful and easy home for the creativity and self-expression of people around the world. Galaxies is deeply committed to supporting and protecting free speech, but there are a number of deeply important lines that are drawn around certain content and behavior that jeopardizes our users, community, and infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h2>What Galaxies is For:</h2>
    <p>
      Galaxies is for showing your life, your eyes, who you are, what you love, in your galaxy is that all your own.
    </p>
    <h2>What Galaxies is Not For:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Hate speech.</strong> Don't encourage violence or hatred. Don't make violent threats or statements that incite violence, on any basis not limited to race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, gender identity, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. If you encounter hate speech in the app, report it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Harm to minors.</strong> Be mindful and protective of the minors around us. Don't post anything that would put a minor in danger or expose a minor on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Promotion or glorification of Self-Harm.</strong> Don't post anything that actively encourages self-harm. This includes content that urges others to cut or injure themselves, embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders, or commit suicide. Your presence and displays online can have an impact on people struggling with these difficult conditions. Support others who are joining together for a supportive conversation around finding help and feeling better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gore, Mutilation, Bestiality, Necrophilia.</strong> Don't post content that would make many others scared. If you see content like this, report it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NSFW content.</strong> Galaxies users come from a variety of locations around the world with different cultures, backgrounds, and points of view. If you regularly post sexual or adult-oriented content, respect the choices of people in our community who would rather not see such content by posting the content on another network.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Schemes.</strong> Schemes for money, likes (even though Galaxy doesn't have likes, someone will inevitably offer to get you more of them), and other digital social currency are around every corner. Do not do this on Galaxies. Do not believe or follow these when you see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hoarding usernames.</strong> Please don't collect, hold, buy, trade, or sell usernames on Galaxies. Galaxies are meant for all. If your name is not 'Kylie Jenner', please do not make your username 'kyliejenner', 'ky1iejenner', or 'ky1iej3nn3r'.
